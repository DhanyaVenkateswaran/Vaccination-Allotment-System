# Vaccination-Allotment-System

# Overview
The project we have chosen for our lab project is a VACCINATION ALLOCATION SYSTEM. What we aim to solve via our project is to help allocate vaccination
centers/hospitals to the general public faster based on their locality and the government age rules.

# Data Structures Used and Why?
-> Graph: Graph would be used to find the nearest vaccination centers/hospital for a given user based on their input address using the DJIKSTRA'S ALGORITHM.
-> Max Heap: We aim to design the application in such a way that people of higher age are given priority to get vaccinated first. Thus, a max heap would be constructed and used to identify these individuals and would be allocated vaccination centers first.
-> Array: Every vaccination center has a count on the maximum number of people they can vaccinate in a day. This count would be stored using arrays.
